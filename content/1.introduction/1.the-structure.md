# The Structure 🏗️

In these guides, I've spiced up the learning experience! Instead of drowning in endless text, you'll find enlightening videos which do the heavy lifting on concepts. Most of these videos are gems that I personally used to learn the realms of web development. They offer a great blend of knowledge and entertainment.

## Creators to Follow 🌟🎥
The creators you'll see are all great and have other interactive tutorials and videos that are not just informative but often sprinkled with humor.

## Learning Tips 🎓
::list{type="danger"}
- **Hands-On Practice**: Watching is alright but isn't enough, doing is even better! Follow along on your computer to let the knowledge stick.
- **Short and Sweet**: No 12-hour coding epics here! I'm really against long tutorial videos, so embrace shorter videos for a quick grasp before diving into your own experiments.
- **Organized Chaos**: Don't stress about perfect organization early on. It's all about having fun and getting the hang of things. Your coding adventure is your canvas.

## DISCLAIMER ⚠️
This guide is designed as a knowledge speedrun for now. We're skipping the deep theory and focusing on hands-on experience. While the nitty-gritty details are essential in the long run, this format gives you a kickstart into the world of fullstack development. So, buckle up for a practical journey! 💻
