# The Structure 🏗️

In these guides, I've spiced up the learning experience! Instead of drowning in endless text, you'll find enlightening videos which do the heavy lifting on concepts. Most of these videos are gems that I personally used to learn the realms of web development. They offer a great blend of knowledge and entertainment.

### Choose Faster or Slower Routes 🏃‍♂️/🐢
The way I'm structuring each topics page is with a faster and slower video. So if you're able to watch the faster video on certain topics and grasp the concepts enough to start coding then that's great! But for many sections, you may not fully understand where to start after watching a really short video with a lot of content. So in those cases you can also continue with the slower videos to better grasp the information before continuing onto a challenge.

### Challenges ❗❗
In each guide, after the content to grasp a basic understanding, there will most likely be a challenge for you to try and complete in order to get your hands a little dirty and build a good project base. They're usually just mini projects to get you started and used to actually coding.

### Recaps 🔄
Sometimes there will be a video at the end of each guide for you to watch to double check you understand the concepts. Usually if watched after completing a challenge for example or practicing a bit, you should know what's being talked about in these recaps.

## Creators to Follow 🌟🎥
The creators you'll see are all great and have other interactive tutorials and videos that are not just informative but often sprinkled with humor.

## Learning Tips 🎓

- **Hands-On Practice**: Watching is alright but isn't enough, doing is even better! Follow along on your computer to let the knowledge stick.
- **Short and Sweet**: No 12-hour coding epics here! I'm really against long tutorial videos, so embrace shorter videos for a quick grasp before diving into your own experiments.
- **Organized Chaos**: Don't stress about perfect organization early on. It's all about having fun and getting the hang of things. Your coding adventure is your canvas.

## DISCLAIMER ⚠️
This guide is designed as a knowledge speedrun for now. We're skipping the deep theory and focusing on hands-on experience. While the nitty-gritty details are essential in the long run, this format gives you a kickstart into the world of fullstack development. So, buckle up for a practical journey! 💻
