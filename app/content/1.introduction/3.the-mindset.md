## Don't Fear, For the Internet Is Here! üåê

In the realm of coding, don't worry about getting stuck at a challenge, for the internet is your ally. Embrace the power of **Google** (Obviously not specifically google but I'm using that search engine as an example) ‚Äì the ultimate tool, your cheat sheet, and the go-to solution for coding hurdles. Coding isn't a test; it's a journey. Even seasoned developers frequently consult the knowledge contained by others on the internet. When faced with errors or roadblocks, someone has likely treaded the same path. Google becomes your guide, and through community forums you'll likely find answers and insights to unravel your errors or general coding questions. Even if it be to remember something simple that you learned already it's fine to check back in an online tutorial quickly which is something many do often.

## Taking Code from the Web ‚ùó

While it's perfectly acceptable to borrow **snippets** from online forums to troubleshoot your code, a crucial rule stands: respect others' work. Avoid wholesale copying of entire code blocks, projects, or ideas without permission. If you're creating something free or open-source, credit the original creators. It's not just about coding etiquette; it's about building a collaborative and supportive community that doesn't come back to bite you in the butt later.

## AI Assistance ü§ñüí°

Curious about using AI, like ChatGPT, to assist in coding? It's a useful tool for generating simple code snippets, starting projects based on your ideas, or helping troubleshoot bugs. However, it's not a magic wand for entire projects. Large language models have their limits ‚Äì they might struggle with complex problems or generate non-functional code. Consider AI a coding companion, enhancing your speed and efficiency. Although I'd suggest beginning with caution and not using it as much right now, gradually integrating it into your workflow as you gain more coding skills. It's nice to code without AI for a while before using it as a helper because you know what you're creating is truly yours.

## How to Learn?
